I am a fourth-year PhD student in Machine Learning at the University of Amsterdam,
advised by <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/j.m.mooij">Prof. Joris M. Mooij</a>. 
My main research interest is (deep) generative modeling from a causal point of view. In particular, I work on learning causal representations of complex (dynamical) systems. 

Prior to my PhD, I obtained a MSc degree in Mathematics, where [Dr. Urs Schreiber](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Urs+Schreiber) was my thesis advisor. Before that, I did a BSc in both Mathematics and in Physics and Astronomy. 

During my studies I had a short interlude in particle physics research at [CERN](https://home.cern/).
