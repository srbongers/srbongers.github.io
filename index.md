I am a machine learning researcher. I have been mainly working on deep generative models from a causal point of view. In particular, I work on causal representations learning from complex environments.

I will obtain my PhD in causal modeling at the <a href="https://www.uva.nl">University of Amsterdam</a> (Amsterdam, The Netherlands), advised by <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/j.m.mooij">Prof. Joris M. Mooij</a>. Prior to that I studied Mathematics and Physics at the <a href="https://www.uu.nl">Utrecht University</a> (Utrecht, The Netherlands), where [Dr. Urs Schreiber](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Urs+Schreiber) was my thesis advisor. During my studies I had a short interlude in particle physics research at [CERN](https://home.cern/). 

During my studies I had a short interlude in particle physics research at [CERN](https://home.cern/) (Meyrin, Switzerland).
