I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Sequential Decision Making group at the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl">Delft Univeristy of Technology</a>, in the Netherlands. 

I am broadly interested in statistics, machine and reinforcement learning, with an eye towards  causal, sequential and anytime-valid inference. 

I have obtained my PhD in causal modeling at the <a href="https://www.uva.nl">University of Amsterdam</a>, advised by <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/j.m.mooij">Prof. Joris M. Mooij</a>. Prior to that I studied Mathematics and Physics at the <a href="https://www.uu.nl">Utrecht University</a>, where [Dr. Urs Schreiber](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Urs+Schreiber) was my thesis advisor. During my studies I had a short interlude in particle physics research at [CERN](https://home.cern/).
